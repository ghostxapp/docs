GhostX uses an energy system to power your outreach. Here's how it works.

## Understanding energy

Energy is the credit system that powers your actions. Every time GhostX posts, replies, or sends a DM, it uses energy.

### Energy costs

| Action | Energy |
|--------|--------|
| Post a tweet | 1 |
| Reply to a tweet | 2 |
| Send a DM | 3 |

The more outreach you do, the more energy you use.

## Estimating your usage

Before choosing a plan, think about how much outreach you want to do:

  <Card title="Light use" icon="feather">
    A few posts and replies per day
  </Card>
  <Card title="Moderate use" icon="gauge">
    Regular posting plus engagement with leads
  </Card>
  <Card title="Heavy use" icon="fire">
    High-volume outreach with lots of DMs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The pricing page has a slider to help you estimate your monthly energy needs.

## Choosing a plan

GhostX offers different plans based on your needs. Each plan includes:
- A monthly energy allowance
- Access to features (some features are only on higher plans)
- Support options

## Managing your subscription

To view or change your plan:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Plan**

Here you can:
- See your current plan
- View your energy balance
- Upgrade or downgrade
- View billing history

## Auto-recharge

Running low on energy? You can enable auto-recharge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open settings">
    Go to **Settings** > **Plan**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable auto-recharge">
    Toggle **Auto-recharge** on
  </Step>
</Steps>

When your energy drops below a threshold, we'll automatically add more and charge your payment method. No interruptions to your outreach.
