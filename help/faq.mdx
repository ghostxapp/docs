Quick answers to common questions.

## Account & Setup

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Missions & Powers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between missions and powers?">
    Missions run automatically on a schedule. Powers are instant actions you trigger manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I stop a mission?">
    Open the mission and toggle off "Automation." The mission will pause until you turn it back on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit a mission after creating it?">
    Yes. Open the mission and click the Configure tab to change the name, brief, or schedule.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why didn't my mission run?">
    Check that:
    - The mission is not paused
    - You have enough energy
    - Your X account is still connected
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Leads

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does GhostX find leads?">
    The AI searches X for people showing interest in topics related to your business. It looks for buying signals like "looking for recommendations" or "need help with."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my leads?">
    Yes. Go to Leads and click Export CSV to download all your lead data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a lead score?">
    The score indicates how likely someone is to be a good fit. Higher scores mean stronger buying signals or better profile matches.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing & Energy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is energy?">
    Energy is the credit system that powers your actions. Posts, replies, and DMs all use energy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does each action cost?">
    - Post = 1 energy
    - Reply = 2 energy
    - DM = 3 energy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of energy?">
    Your missions will pause. You can upgrade your plan, enable auto-recharge, or wait for your next monthly refill.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel my subscription?">
    Yes, anytime. Go to Settings > Plan to manage your subscription.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## AI Chat

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can I ask the AI?">
    Almost anything related to your outreach:
    - Write content
    - Find leads
    - Analyze your performance
    - Get strategy advice
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the AI remember previous conversations?">
    Yes. Each conversation keeps its history, and you can continue past conversations from the History page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the AI post directly to X?">
    Yes. The AI can take actions like posting, replying, and sending DMs—not just give suggestions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I post more than once every few hours?">
    GhostX enforces rate limits to protect your X account. Posting too frequently can trigger X's spam detection and get your account restricted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My mission stopped replying. What happened?">
    You may have hit the reply limit (10 per 30 minutes). The AI will automatically resume once the limit resets. It will focus on other actions in the meantime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do rate limits use my energy?">
    No. When an action is blocked by rate limits, no energy is consumed. You only use energy for successful actions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I increase the rate limits?">
    No. These limits are set to keep your account safe and are based on X's known thresholds.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My X account shows a yellow status">
    This means the connection needs attention. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The AI isn't doing what I asked">
    Try being more specific in your request. Instead of "engage with people," try "find 5 tweets about marketing tools and reply with helpful tips."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm not seeing any leads">
    Make sure your missions are set up to find leads. Check that your brief includes instructions to look for potential customers.
  </Accordion>
