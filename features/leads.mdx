GhostX helps you find and manage potential customers. These are your leads—people who might be interested in what you offer.

## How GhostX finds leads

The AI searches X for people showing buying intent. It looks for signals like:
- "Looking for a tool to help with..."
- "Anyone have recommendations for..."
- "Need help with..."

When it finds someone who might be a good fit, it saves them as a lead.

## Viewing your leads

1. Go to **Leads** in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all discovered leads

For each lead, you can see:
- **Profile** — Their name, username, and bio
- **Score** — How likely they are to be a good fit (higher is better)
- **Status** — New, contacted, or ignored
- **When found** — The date they were discovered

## Lead details

Click on any lead to see more:
- Their full profile information
- The tweet or post where they showed interest
- Your interaction history with them
- Notes you've added

## Managing lead status

Keep track of where each lead is in your pipeline:

  <Card title="New" icon="sparkles">
    Just discovered, not contacted yet
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contacted" icon="paper-plane">
    You've reached out to them
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ignored" icon="ban">
    Not a good fit
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To change status, open the lead and select a new status.

## Targets

Targets are high-value accounts you want to engage with regularly. These might be:
- Competitors' followers
- Industry influencers
- Potential partners

The Targets tab helps you track these accounts and reminds you to engage with them.

Targets are available on the Company plan.
