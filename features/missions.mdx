Missions are the heart of GhostX. They're automated tasks that run on a schedule, doing outreach for you while you focus on other things.

## What is a mission?

A mission is a set of instructions you give to the AI. You describe what you want in plain English, and the AI figures out how to do it.

### Example missions
- "Find tweets about marketing automation and reply with helpful tips"
- "Post 3 times a day about AI tools"
- "Send a friendly DM to new followers"

## Creating a mission

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Missions">
    Go to **Missions** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new">
    Click **Create Mission**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your mission">
    Give your mission a name (e.g., "Daily engagement")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your brief">
    Describe what you want the AI to do
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose schedule">
    Select when and how often to run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Click **Create** and your mission is now active!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing a good brief

The brief is where you tell the AI what to do. Be clear and specific:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good brief
Find tweets from people looking for project management tools. Reply with a helpful tip and mention our tool if relevant. Keep replies friendly and not salesy.
```

```text Too vague
Engage with people
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tips for writing briefs
- Describe the type of content to look for
- Explain how you want to engage (reply, like, DM)
- Set the tone (friendly, professional, casual)
- Mention any topics to avoid

## Scheduling options

Choose how often your mission runs:

- **One-time** — Runs once at a specific time
- **Daily** — Runs every day at a set time
- **Weekly** — Runs on specific days each week
- **Custom** — Set your own interval

You can change the schedule anytime.

## Running a mission manually

Don't want to wait for the schedule?

1. Open the mission
2. Click **Run Now**

The mission will execute immediately.

## Pausing and resuming

Need to stop a mission temporarily?

1. Open the mission
2. Toggle **Automation** off

Turn it back on when you're ready to resume.

## Viewing mission history

See what your mission has been doing:

1. Open the mission
2. Click the **History** tab

You'll see a log of every time the mission ran and what it did.

## Understanding energy costs

Each action uses energy (credits):

| Action | Energy Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| Post | 1 energy |
| Reply | 2 energy |
| DM | 3 energy |

When creating a mission, you'll see an estimate of how much energy it will use. Keep an eye on your energy balance in your account settings.

## Rate limits

To protect your X account, GhostX enforces rate limits on actions. When a limit is reached, the AI will pause that action type and focus on other tasks. Actions resume automatically once the limit resets.

- **Filter** — Show only active or paused missions
- **Switch views** — See missions as cards, list, table, or calendar
