description: "How GhostX protects your X account with safe automation limits"
---

GhostX enforces rate limits to keep your X account safe. These limits prevent actions that could trigger X's spam detection systems.

## Why rate limits exist

X monitors account activity for spam-like behavior. If you post, reply, or follow too quickly, X may:
- Temporarily restrict your account
- Flag your account for review
- Permanently suspend your account

<Info>
GhostX automatically enforces safe limits so you don't have to worry about this.

## Current limits

| Action | Limit | Resets after |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Replies** | 10 | 30 minutes |
| **Posts** | 1 | 4 hours |
| **Threads** | 1 | 4 hours |
| **Quote tweets** | 1 | 4 hours |
| **Retweets** | 1 | 1 hour |
| **Likes** | 20 | 1 hour |
| **Follows** | 20 | 1 hour |
| **Follows (daily)** | 100 | 24 hours |
| **Unfollows** | 20 | 1 hour |
| **DMs** | 10 | 1 hour |
| **DMs (6 hour)** | 50 | 6 hours |
| **DMs (daily)** | 100 | 24 hours |

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check limits">
    Before each action, GhostX checks if you're within limits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Proceed or pause">
    If within limits, the action proceeds normally. If at limit, the AI pauses that action type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on other tasks">
    The AI continues with other tasks that aren't limited
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-reset">
    Limits reset automatically after the time window passes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens when you hit a limit?

The AI will:
- Stop attempting that action type
- Continue with other tasks that aren't limited
- Resume the limited action once the window resets

<Note>
You don't lose any energy when an action is blocked by rate limits.
</Note>

## Per-project limits

Rate limits are tracked per project (per X account). If you have multiple projects with different X accounts, each has its own separate limits.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I increase my rate limits?">
    No. These limits are set to protect your X account from restrictions. They're based on X's known thresholds and our experience with safe automation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is my mission not posting?">
    If you've already posted recently, you may have hit the 1 post per 4 hours limit. Wait for the limit to reset, or check if your mission can do other actions like replying instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do likes and follows share the same limit?">
    No. Each action type has its own separate limit. You can do 20 likes AND 20 follows in the same hour.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What about reading actions?">
    Reading actions (searching tweets, viewing profiles, finding leads) have no rate limits. Only actions that create or modify content are limited.
