Projects help you organize your work in GhostX. Each project is like a separate workspace for a brand, business, or campaign.

## What is a project?

A project contains:
- Your connected X accounts
- Your missions and powers
- Your leads and targets
- Your AI conversation history

If you manage multiple brands or businesses, you can create a separate project for each one.
