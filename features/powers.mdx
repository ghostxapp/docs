Powers are quick actions you can run anytime. Think of them as shortcuts for common tasks.

## What are powers?

Unlike missions (which run on a schedule), powers are instant. You click, and they run right away.

### Examples of powers
- "Reply to 5 high-engagement tweets in my niche"
- "Generate a viral tweet about my product"
- "Find 10 leads interested in marketing tools"

## Using powers

### From the Home page
Your favorite powers appear as chips at the top of your dashboard. Just click one to run it.

## Favoriting powers

Want quick access to powers you use often?

1. Go to **Powers**
2. Click the star icon on any power

## Organizing your powers

You can reorder your powers by dragging them. Put your most-used powers at the top.

## Customizing a power

Each power has a prompt that tells the AI what to do. You can edit it:

1. Go to **Powers**
2. Click the edit icon on a power
3. Change the name or prompt

This lets you tailor powers to your specific needs.
