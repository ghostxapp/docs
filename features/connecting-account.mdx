To post, reply, and engage on X (Twitter), you need to connect your X account to GhostX.

## Why connect your account?

When you connect your X account, GhostX can:
- Post tweets on your behalf
- Reply to relevant posts
- Send direct messages
- Find and engage with leads
- Track your account growth

<Note>
You stay in control—GhostX only does what you ask it to do.
</Note>

## How to connect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Channels">
    Go to **Channels** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect account">
    Click the **Connect Account** tab, then click **Connect X Account**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize on X">
    You'll be redirected to X to authorize the connection
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review permissions">
    Review the permissions and click **Authorize**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    You're connected!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing connected accounts

In the **Connected Accounts** tab, you can see all your linked X accounts. For each account, you'll see:

- **Profile picture and username**
- **Status** — Whether the connection is healthy (green) or needs attention (yellow)
- **Capabilities** — What GhostX can do: Posts, Replies, DMs, Leads
- **Last sync** — When we last checked your account

## Disconnecting an account

If you need to disconnect:

1. Go to **Channels**
2. Find the account you want to remove
3. Click **Disconnect**

<Info>
Your data stays safe—disconnecting just removes GhostX's access to post on your behalf.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection shows yellow status
This usually means the connection needs to be refreshed. Try disconnecting and reconnecting.

### Can't authorize on X
Make sure you're logged into the correct X account before authorizing.

### Missing capabilities
Some features require specific X account settings. Check that your X account allows third-party apps.

## Multiple accounts

You can connect multiple X accounts to the same project. This is useful if you manage several accounts for the same brand.

Each account can have its own missions and powers.
